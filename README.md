# Comic Downloader

## Description

This is a network programming project written  in Python to automate the download of comic images from the [GoComics](https://www.gocomics.com) website. The program allows users to select from a list of cat-themed comics and input a specific date to download the comic image for that specific day.

The downloader uses:
- **Selenium** to handle JavaScript-rendered content.
- **BeautifulSoup** to parse HTML.
- **Requests** to fetch image content.
- **Pillow (PIL)** to save the image as a JPEG.

## Features

- Menu to choose from multiple cat-themed comics.
- Supports date-based retrieval in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- Downloads and saves the comic locally.
- Headless browser mode for reduced overhead.

## Installation

You can use the provided `Makefile`:

```make```
## Acknowledgment
Some code parts related to web scraping with BeautifulSoup and Selenium were taken from open-source sources to understand best practices for parsing HTML.

During development, I initially attempted to retrieve the comic image by parsing the static HTML manually and then using BeautifulSoup. However, I found that the image is generated by JavaScript after the page loads, which means that the tag does not exist in the original HTML source. Because of this, I had to switch to Selenium, which runs a real browser session and allows scraping content rendered by JS. This approach worked but it is much slower than parsing static content.
